# In options trading, an option with a 50 delta has an approximate 50% probability of being "in-the-money" (ITM) at expiration, which implies a 50% risk of assignment for the option seller. This type of option is referred to as at-the-money (ATM).
# A 25% delta option has roughly a 25% chance of expiring in-the-money (ITM) and implies a lower risk of early assignment, especially for puts, compared to options closer to the stock price (ATM/ITM). A 0.25 delta option means its price changes by about $0.25 for every $1 move in the underlying stock, representing an option that is "out-of-the-money" (OTM) and less likely to be exercised early. 
# In options trading, an option with a delta of 0.75 (or 75) has an approximate 75% probability of expiring in-the-money (ITM), which translates to a 75% risk of assignment for the seller of that option. 
# A 10% delta option (like selling a 10-delta call or put) signifies a relatively low risk of assignment because it suggests about a 10% chance of expiring in-the-money (ITM), meaning it's far out-of-the-money (OTM) and needs a significant price move in the underlying stock to be exercised, making it a conservative income strategy. While delta gives an estimate, factors like time to expiration (less time = more risk) and volatility also affect actual assignment probability, but 10 delta is generally considered low-risk for sellers seeking premium with infrequent assignment. 

# a 20 delta option is commonly expressed as 0.20 (or just .2 or 20%), and it implies an approximate 20% chance of the option expiring in-the-money (ITM), which is related to assignment risk. 

# Here is how delta is used in options trading:
As a Decimal/Whole Number: While mathematically it is a value between 0 and 1 (or 0 and -1 for puts), traders often refer to it as a whole number from 0 to 100. So, a delta of 0.20 is called a "20 delta" option.
