detailed description of this calc [what it is ] and its justification

What exactly is the "25-Delta Put/Call Implied Volatility Skew" (25Δ skew)?

Precise Definition
For a given expiration (typically 60- or 90-day),
- 25-delta put: out-of-the-money put with delta ≈ –0.25 (usually 6–15% below current stock price)
- 25-delta call: out-of-the-money call with delta ≈ +0.25 (usually 6–15% above current stock price)

25Δ Skew = Implied Volatility of the 25-delta put − Implied Volatility of the 25-delta call
(or sometimes Put IV / Call IV ratio)

A large positive value (+12 to +25 points or higher) = strong negative volatility skew = downside puts are dramatically more expensive than upside calls.

Why this metric is powerful and justified

1. Measures real institutional hedging demand
   Institutions that own large long positions hedge almost exclusively with OTM puts, not calls. When they aggressively buy protection, 25-delta put IV gets bid up far more than symmetric calls → the metric directly captures that one-sided fear.

2. Sticky and slow-mean-reverting
   Unlike total IV that collapses after earnings, downside skew in quality growth stocks persists for months as big holders continuously roll hedges.

3. Best proxy for the “insurance premium” the market is willing to pay you
   Selling the rich 25-delta put = selling overpriced tail-risk insurance to terrified long-only funds, often yielding 1.5–3× more than a comparable straddle/strangle.

4. Naturally surfaces “stocks people are afraid to lose but refuse to sell”
   Highest negative skew appears in names with massive ownership, strong moats, and secular growth (TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, etc.) → exactly the stocks premium sellers are happy to own on assignment.

5. Filters out junk
